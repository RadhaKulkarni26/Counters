# Counters
### Counters are the sequential circuits which are used to count the pulses. It has input clock signal and group of output signals which display the count value. Upon each defined clock edge, it will either increment or decrement the count value. Flip flops are used as memory element. For an N bit counter, the maximum count will be 2^n.
